gIt should be indeed a source of honest aud patriotic
exultation ιο every trueborn American, ιο think that, by
the zealous exertions os au obscure, an humble‚ and un·
hnown individual, the fame os his country's brightest
ornament may be spread from one extremity of the
civihzed world ιο the other: that it may do so rs our
earnest wish; and, as a first step towards this end, we
strenuously advisa its immediate adoption as a class-
book in all our district schools, and should further be in-
clined to advocate its admission into the higher institu-
tione for the dissemination of learning. In recommend-
ing this work so strongly to the public, and especially to
the instructore and guardians of youth, we are fully
· borne out by the strongly-expressed opinions, ιο the same
effect as curs, of the best and ripest scholare os our
country, which will be sound appended to the text.

From tlte Nero-Yorll American.

A arra of Washington, written in pure, flowing, easy,
and classical Latin, by a country schoolmaster in Ohio,
whose lise was passed 1n teaching the children ol his
country neighbours ιο read and write, is certainly a re·
markable productiori. The circumstances under which
it was composed, together with the manner in which the
editor, Mr. Reynolds, became acquainted with the author,
are told in amost interesting manner in lllr. R.’s preface,

from which we make no apology sor extracting largely.

The interest ol this story may justly add ιο that os the
work it ushers forth3 and when it is said that Professor
Anthou of Columbia Collega, Professor Patton of the
Now-York University, Professor Wylie os the University
os Pennsylvania‚ and other approved scholare, bear wit·
ness to the purity ol the style in which it is written, it is
not an unreasonable hope ιο express, that this life of
Washington may become an elementary class-boort iu our

Latin schools. U
