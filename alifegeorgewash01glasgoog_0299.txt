nlsed as not Athenian, by the over-strictness of their Attic
Greek, by the stiff precision, the ornate redundancy, and
the servile imitation of ancient models. Not content
with being well acquainted with the language, the com·
posers of scholastic Latin have for the most part applied

themselves to copy word for word, and sentence for sen-
tence, the style of this or that Roman author. Every
phrase was modelled upon the shape of the phrase oc·

Sallust or (licerer so that the entire work has been

patches, than an original composition.

Widely different from this is the Life of Washington,
by Francis Glass-he has written with a full mind, with

is in the universal longus, the one language current among
the scientific and the polishad from Buenos Ayres to lce-

Atlantia, it may become a text-book and a standing history
in other hemispheres-that it may be studied by mysti-

that it may be mused over by the Spanish Creole of
Mexico or Paraguay; that it may inspira the hyperborean
Russ with the ardent love os liberty, and teach to the
volatile Gaul stability and sumnam, by the noble example
of the most equable and constant-minded man, the firm·
