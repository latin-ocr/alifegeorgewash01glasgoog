I nure examined with some attention the sheets os e
Lise os Washington, in Latin, by Francis Glaes, A. Μ.,
and 1 consider the worlr a performance of no small merit.
In regard to the style os composition, the writer hae euc-
ceeded sar beyond the ordinary efforts at writing in Latin.
The idiom is remarkably pure, the words being selected
with careful attention to precision and classic use. The
barbarismo which the introduction of modern institutione
and observanoes, particularly the science of war, and
legislation, must necessarily compel the writer to use,
are so skilsully reduced to the forms of Roman decien-
sion, that they are not, in general, offenaive. Many of
them are words erceedingly sonorous and descriptiva.
Another difficulty of no small importance in writing Lat·
in is, the proper uee of ‘⁸ equivalente,'’ arising from the
circumstance, tlrat of the numerous classes of worda
which our language has borrowed from that, the greater
portion of them have now a meaning different from the
original; and the use os these words iu the same sense
which is annexed to the analogous English terms, would
be a barbarous perversiori of their meaning, offensive to
purity and good teste. In avoiding these, the writer oi
this work shows accurate and faithful training. But he
has not merely freedom srorn faults; he possessas posi-
tive excellences. In his periods‚ he has generally the
flow and graceful variety which ere the principal chenu
of the style os history, exhibiting much of ancient digni-
ty and simplicity‚ and occasionally turning them with un-
common elegance. ln description he is not deficient in
strength end energy‚ but is easy, and sufficiently diffuse
to avoid the meagemees of a mere annalist. The life of
the venerated Father of our Country‚ a character so tull
of moral and intellectual grandem, can be delineated in ·
no so appropriate diction as in the severe and mejeetic
simplicity of the Roman. And the youthsul student of
classic enthusiasm will find the history of his beloved
eounuy invested with a charming interest, when he meets
