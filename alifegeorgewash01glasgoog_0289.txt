Mn. Ronuouor,

Sru,-—Accept my thanks lor the copy os “ the Lite of
Georgo Washington, in Latin prose.” lam much pluas·
ed with both the plan and the execution os the work.
While our youth are called upon, in many instances, to
etudy elementary books in our primary schools, composed
conlessedly by modern scholare, on subjecte os comper-
atively minor importante, why should they not be fur-
nished with elementary books sor their earlier course,
adopted to furnish a knowledge of our own history, and
especially of the lise us one whom Amerina, and I mor
say also Europe, is proud to honour.

With my best wishes sor your success in endeavouring
to introduce the work into our primary schools,
I em, dear sir, yours,&c.

ROBERT B. PATTON.
