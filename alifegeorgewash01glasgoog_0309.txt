admirable. He has not given us a narrative in Latinized

English, but his hook throughout savours of an original
Roman idiom.

Such an undertaking is much more difficult than the
writing os Latin profanes and annotatione to classic au·
thora, or biographical sketcbes os men who lived in a
classic era, like the Viri Romo os L’Homond.

That the authoris sometimes obscure, and· is occa·
sionally led to adopt a harsh or false idiom, is not a matter
of surprise when we consider the difficulty os adapting an
obsoleta language to novel events and operatione. Nai-
buhr, the historiari, coniessed, late in his lise, that although
he had from childhood written Latin, “ it was only within
slew years that he had been able to call the language his
own.” Of our author's style no more can he said hyway
os criticism than was said of the illustrioris Hcmsterhuys,
“Una orationi facilitas deest, non comparanda illa, nisi
saepe multumque scribendo.’' But in the style oi the
author, there is osten a felicity oi expression, a union ot'
brevity‚ accuracy‚ and clearness which must surprise
every classica] reader. In some passages there is a de·
gree os eloquence and sustained vigour, not unworthy the
pen of Caesar himself. li, throughout the work, there
are occasional transgressions oi that tame correctness
which characterizes the continental school-book Latin, it
is not, like thern, in any part, a mere accommodatiori and
transcript os ancient formulas cf speech and set phrases.
It is evidently the product of a mind thoroughly imbued
with the principles and genius of the Roman tongue, and
capable os forming new combinatione to suit new circum·
stanceS, in strict accordance with the analogias of the
Latin language.

I think it is well suited, in every respect, to the pur-
poses oi instruction in classical schools; especially is
the teacher be competent to turn even passages os ques·
tionahle Latinity to good account by verbalcriticisms. Ι
have strongly recommendcd it for that purpose in this vi-
cinity‚ and hope it will come into general use. Itis a
grean recommendation of the hook in this particular, that
it is so well printed. If Ι had never studied worse type
