classical schools; sor surely as Americans we should
prefer to put into the hands of our youth the lise us the
Father of their Country, instead ol those other works in
modern Latin, which are now so extensively used.

The incidente os the narration are well selected; and
considering the difficulty of describing modern events in
an ancient tongue, the ingenuity of the author in the se·
lection of his words, in the expressiveness of his phrase·
ology, and in adhering to e purely classicalidiom, is truly
