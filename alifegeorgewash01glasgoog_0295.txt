itast iudicatione ol a kindred spirit with that ol tlte author
ol* the work. Mr. lleynolds is, iu fact, endtled to the
greatest praise lor his agency iu bringing this book be·
fore the public. The very interesting biography he has
giren os his friend and instructer, and the classical rem-
iniscences that are scattered throughout, show a wor-
thy pupil os an able preceptor; and the whole forms one
of the most lasting and honourable monuments that could
heve been erected to the memory os the Erasmus of the
West. Our readers will not, we trust, regard us as at
all extravagant in the praise we have here bestowed,
when they examine the testimonials appended to the vol·

with the literati os our country. [A part of the account

will meet with a success which shall induce other efforts
cf the kind, and crush in the bud the insane conspiracy
against the learned tongues which seems blowing into
life in certain parts os the Union. Let but the lives os
our distinguished men, and the thrilling soenes in which
they played a part, he embalmed in the noble languages
os antiquity-let the associatione of patriotic story be
liuked in the mind of the young student with the medium
in which it is here conveyed, and the classice will be ιο
intrenched in the affections of the rising genoration, that
no new-langled systems, however backed by popular
clamour, can ever banish them from among our element-
ary studies. The work besore us we may take eruther
