Mi· Dran Sua—I have been slovv in expressiug an
opinion of your Gloss's Life of Woslington, not from in-
differenoe to its menits, but because 1 have thought it
deserving oi a more caroiul und critical reading thanI
at first intended to give it. It is not only a literary curios-
ity.‘but in truth a work ol' rare merit. We have been so
liure accustomed to look for works of this kind among
ourselvea, aud so much in the habitos depending upon
the Germane for our preliminary Latin books, that even
our national vanity does not prevent us froin the exorciso
of exemplary cautiou and scrutiuy before we seriously
tall os introducing American Latin into our schools. 1
herard the opinion, however, that, while we all agree that
the finish ancl ripeness of classical scholarslrip can only
be attained by a patient and long-continued study of tha
ulmeio medela· Gloss’s Life os Wusltington will bo found,
even in point os Latinity, to deservo a place in the pro-
scribed course of studies preparatory to our collegas,
andl shall rejoioe to seo it holding the position which it
ments in our best Latin schools and academie· through·
out tho country.

I romain, sir, with sincere respect,
Your friend and servent,

CHAUNCEY COLTON.
