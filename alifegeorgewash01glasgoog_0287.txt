the matchless deeds oi his ioreiathers, the heroes aud
seges os the Revolution, clothed in the noble and digni·
fied periods ol a lauguage which claime the homage oi
the learned world.

lausannen that this work, from the excellence oi
its style, arrd its rich materiale of biography and history,
will become a popular and valuable elementary book in
our schools. Severe criticism may detect some “ Pata·
vinities ;” but, considering the circumstances under which
it was written, 1 consider it an extraordinary productiori.

l shall immediately adopt it as a class-book.

Tua Lise os Washington, by Francis Gloss, is, in the
opinion os the subscribet, a work of singular merit, and oi
that degree oi excellence which is claimed sor it hythe
editor, who, by its publication, has discharged a just deht
oi gratitudo to his able preceptor.

An unqualified approval is not claimed sor the work,
nor is it the deeign os the subscriber to girolt such a
one. His engagements, during the time it has been in
his hands, have not admitted of his examining the entire
work, yet he doubts not thata perusal os the whole would
serve only to deepen the favourable impressione already
received.

The handsome manner in which the work is presented
to the public, reflects great credit upon all concerned in
its publication.

lt is to be hoped that the youth os our country may
, become familiar with this productiori os aripe scholar;
and that they may learn to emulate the author's ardour in
the study os tho ancient classice.
