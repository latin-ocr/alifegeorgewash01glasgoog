Dm S1n‚-In compliance with your tequea, Ι have

¹ examined “A Life os Wuhington, in Latin Prone, by

Francis Glm, Α. M.‚0s 0h10.” My opinion os this per·
romanco is, thnt ln purity os style, rotundity of period,
md Judicious ”lection of words, it in exoeoded bynono
of the modern works introductory to the study os the
ancient Roman classico. Itu imperfection· ue sm it·
boantis· numerous. It will bo ι νιΙιιεδῙο acquisitiou to
our clmicul scheon, initiatory to Com or Nepos, or
nuchfim Roman author ιι the toacher may κο otuu ω
tdopt Such an American book hus hitherto boon ι do·
uideramm. It i· now furnishod. lt is well calculated
to fito the youthful genius, aud inspiro the ganemu· mind
with the purant patriotic sentimentu.

In thus exproeuing myuols, 1 cannot help mingling
nome feeling with my recollections os tho author. Im
, noquainted with Mr. Glm from his boyiuh days. He
was an enthusiautio votary os the clusio muso immedi-
ately on his initiation into the Gramma SchooL 'l'hat
he laboured notin vain, this production will be aluting
memorial.
