bach's lombardo, sor 8 oannem Milton's globulus, 1088
butt0n; 08 Grotius' aopilconeatom, 108 8 wig. As 8 spe-
cimen 01 Μ8. G.'s Latinity. we euhj0in an extract 180888
1188 work. lt is Judge Marshall’s announcement in Con·
grass 01 the death 01 Washington.

The “ barbarisms'' 01 Μ8. Glass are always 80 wellin
accordance with the genius 01 Latin declension, as never

to appear at variance with the spirit os the language‚ or
out of placeio their respective situations. His “equiv-
alents,'' too, are, in all cases, ingeniously managed: and
we are mistahen ii the same can be said 01 the “ equiv-
alents'' 01 Erasmus—certainly not 01 those used by Gro-
tius, nr Addisou, 08 Schroeckh, 08 Buchanan, neither 01
whom is scrupulous in introducing words from which a
modern one is deduced, in the exact sense 01 the Eng-
lish analogous term, although that term may have been
greatly perverted lrom its original meaning.

Ι aava examined the ‘⁶ Life 01 Washington, in Latin
Prose, by Francis Glass, A. M, 01 0hio,'' edited by J.
Ἴ N. Reynolds, and look upon it as a work 01 merit, evin·
cing more than ordinary classical attainments in the
author. lt contains a collection 01 useful historical
18018, narrated in every pleasing‚ animated style. Itis
8 very good specimen 01 modern Latinity; the language
correct, the words 01 great purity, and the peculiarity 01
the Latin idiom being preserved with great purity through-
out. It presente numerous examples 01 the happy trans·
lation 01 modern ideas, words, and phrases, into the
ancient language. It might be a valuable addition to
the private library 01 1180 student 01 Latin, indueing him,
hythe interest 01 1188 subject and style, toa voluntary
perusal 01 works in that ancient language; and it might
be read extempore before the instructor with advantage,
