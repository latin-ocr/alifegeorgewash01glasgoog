of what genius and labour, uneided and nnencuuraged,
ean accomplish, is truly e tayo meta. But this work is
not merely interesting es a curiosity. It is written with
surprising accuracy, aud really possessos no common
portion of the ease, spirit, and raeiness of classical com·
position Mr. Reynolds desertos well of his country for
his attempt ιο introduce it into our schools es a book of
elementary instruction. It is not only quite equel, iu
point of Latinity, ιο many uf the worlrs of modern schol-
ιη which ere alreedy in use for thet purpose, but ite sub-
ject will give it a fer higher interest for American youth,
while it serves ιο keep before their miuds the example of
thet “ august and immonni man,” the spirit of whose his·
tory will do scarcely lese to preserve the liberties of his
country, than the wiedum of the institutione which he has
bequeethed her. Ι

1 cannot conclude this notice without alluding to the
effectionate end eloquent tribute which Mr. Reynolds hes
psid to the memcry of his friend end instructor, in the
introductory memoir, and which, from its tendency ιο
cherieh agenoreus love of classicul studies, contributus
not a little, in my opinion, ιο the charm and value of the

work. J . PROUDFIT

Dein Suu-I have examined Mr. Glass's Life of Wesh·
ington in Latin, and have formed every favourable opin-
ion of its general merite. Though the work has some
desecte, yet these are trifliug when compared with its
excellences; and many parts display e purity of style,
sufficient to rank the author very rugh in the scale of
modern Latin writers. It will be perused with interest
and utility by the youthful mind, and deserves to finde
place in the library of the classicel scholar.
