unanimorum.

From the Seuthem Literary Mersenger sor Deo, 1835.

Wu may truly say thot not for years haro we taken up
a volume with which we have been so highly gratified aa
with the one now before us. A Life of Washington,
succinet in sorni, yet in matter sufficiently comprehensive,
has been long a desideratum: but aLise of Washingtou,
precisely such as a compendious life os that great man
should be-written by a citizen os Ohio-and written, too,
in Latin, which is not one jot inferior to the Latinos
Erasmus, is, to say the least os it, s novelty.

We consess that we regarded the first announcement
os this raro cois with an evil and suspicious eye. The
thing was improbable, wo thought. Mr. Reynolds was
quizzing us-the brothers Harper were hoaxed-and
Messieurs Anthon and Co. were mistaken. At all eventa,
we had made up our minda to be especially severe upon
Mr. Glass, and to put no saith in that species of classical
Latin which should emanata from the bsckwoods of Ohio.
We now solemnly make arecantation os our preconceired
opinions, en'd so procaed immediately to do penance sor
our unbelies.

Mr. Reynolds is eutitled to the thanks os hio country- ,

men for his instrumentality in bringing this book before
the public. It has already done wonders in the cause oi
the classios3 and we are false prophete is it do not ulti·
mately prove the means os stirring up to a new life and
a regenerated energy that love of tha learned tongues
which is the surest protectiorr of our own vernacular lan·
guage srorn impurity‚ but which, we are grieved to see, is.
in a languishing and dying condition in the land.

We have read Mr. Μ preface with great attention3
end meeting with it, as we have done, among a multipli-
city os worldly concerns and every-day matters and oc·
cunonem, it will long romain impressed upon our mindo
as an episode os the purest romanoe. We have no diffi-
culty iu entering sully with Mr. Reynolds into his kindly
feelings towards Mr. Glass. We perceive at once that
we could have loved and reverenced the man. His im-
age is engraren upon our fancy. Indeed, we behold him
