nou-at thie very moment-with all his oddities and ep-
pertenanees about him. We behold the low log cabin
of a schoolhouse—the clapboard roos but indifferenti]
eight-the holes, yeleped windows, covered with oiled .
paper to keep out the air-the benches oi hewn timber

stuck fast in the ground-the stove, the deek, the urchine,
and the Professor. We can hear the worthy pedagogue’s
classical ‘⁴ Salvee,’' and our ears are still tingling with his
hyperclassicai exhortatione. In tuith, he was a man after
our own heart, and, were we not Alexander, we should
have luxuriated in being Glaes.

A word or two respecting the Latinity of the book.
We sincerely think that ithae been underrated. While
we agree with Mr. Reynolde‚ for whose opinions. gen·

consideration, we really can call to mind, at this moment,
no modern Latin composition whatever much superior to
the Waeht'ngtonit' Vita of Mr. Glass.

The clothing of modern ideas in a language dead lor

appreciated by those who have never undertaken it. The
various changes and modificatione which, since the Au· ,
guetan age, have corne to pass in the sciencee os war and
legislation especially, must render any attempt similar to
that which we are now criticising one of the most haz-
ardoue and awkward imaginable. But we cannot help
thinking thatour author has succeeded d merveille. His
ingenuity is not less remarkable than his grammatical
skill. indeed, he is never at a loss. Itis nonaense to
laugh at his calling Quakers Tremebundi. Tremeiundi is
ae good Latin ae Trementes, and more euphonical Latin
than Qualem—sor both which lattererpressione we have
