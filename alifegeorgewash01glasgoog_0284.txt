Ar the request of Mr. Reynolds‚l have exemined the
manuscript ofa Latin Biography of Weshington, by the

late hir. Glass, of 0hio, end consider it well worthy of .

publication. It is, indeed, quita 'e curiosity os its kind.
There is generally an siros stiffness in the productioris
of modern Latinists, which soon betraysa want os fa-
miliarity‚ on the partos the writer, with the idiom ern·
ployed by him. Nothing of this nature is to be discor·
ered in the present work3 on the contrary, the most cur·
sory reader cannot fail to be struck with the easy flow
of the style, end the gracelul turn of very many os the peri·
ods. The core, too, which has been exercised in the se·
. lection of appropriate terma and phrases is worthy cf
notice, especially when taken in connexion with the fact
of the euthor's having written his work without the aid
of any books of reference. end his having been compel-
led, consequently‚ to rely solely on the stores os his own
memory. l would not wish to be understood as viewing
this productiori in the light of an accuretely critical end
finished pisce, but yet 1 cannot help thinking that it will
make every good school-book. For the subject will in-
terest the young scholar, end awaken the best feelings in
his bosom; while, if the Latinity of the work should at
any time appear to the instructer of e questionable or er·
roneous character, he can consult the improvement ol
his pupils, and at the same time display his own acumen,

in suggesting other and better expressions.
