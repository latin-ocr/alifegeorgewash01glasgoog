naumurum.

From tlte Nero-Yocker.

In is with no small satisfaction we announce to our
readers the appearance of this werlu because it cannot
fail to produce the bappiest effecto upon the rising gener·
arion, when introduced imo our schools as a class-book,
which it undoubtedly will be. Α life of Washington in
Latin is indeed peculiarly appropriate on many accounts.
Whose deeds more worthy of its lofty dictioni Whose
virtues more deserving of its majestic simplicityi What
Roman could boast of alife so pure l-of patriotism so
disinterestedl It is well to place in the hands of our
youth this record of the Father of his country, in the
same language in which they read of the ralour of Ceasar,
of the prudence of Fabius, and the virtues of Cincinna-
tus; for it will enable them, with a glow of honest pride,
to feel that in Washingtou all these rare and exalted at·
tributas were combined. Nor will it be less gratifying
to them to knoW, that in tha wilds of Ohioe ‘⁶ δίαιθ’ has
been found to hold up to the world an imperirhable image
of him who has been emphatioally and truly pronounced
to be the “ first in war, first in peace, aud first in the hearts
of his countrymen.”

of its Latinity end style it would ill become us to speak,
since sufficient proof accompanios the work, in the certifi-
cates annexed to it, of many of our professura, who beer
ample testimony to its purity, its beauty, and its force.

From the Nero-York Times.

Tuis, if it be not the best, is the most extraordinary
book of the day. Asa specimen of pure Latiniry. rt has
been pronounced by the best scholars in the country to
be a singularly correct aud beautiful production. It
comes before the public in a manner which should com-
mend it to its kindest attention, and if, as we have every
reason to believe, it is a specimen of Latinity as pure as
it is uncommon, there can be no doubt that it will bo gen·
emlly adopted by our schools and seminaries of learning.
We shall again allude to this extraordinary production3
and in the meantime we commend it to the attention of
tha scholare of eur country.
