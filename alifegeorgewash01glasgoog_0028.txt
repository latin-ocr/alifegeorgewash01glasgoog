Vemon, and the delineation of the characteres
Washington, the most rigid critic will find much
to commend. The notes speek for themselves.
The author evidently had in view the possibility
of his work being introduced into schools, and
they were therefore written for the benefit, prin· ¹
cipelly, of the younger classes readers, though,
occasionally, they assume a higher and graver
character.

ln conclusion, the editor entertains the hope,
that the little work which is here offered to the
literati of his country, will be kindly received by
them, and bc found not undeserving of their notice.
It is the productiones apoor and almost friend-
less individuel, whom a sound end liberal educa-
ticn had fitted for highcr pursuits, but whom mis-
fortune and disappointment had driven from the
scenes of his earlier years, to the more congenial
solitudes oi the West. And it will show the power-
ful influence that classical studies, when properly

pursued, are calculated to exercisc over the mind ;

how they cling to it, even amid misiortune, and
impert a sure solaco under all the ills of life.
