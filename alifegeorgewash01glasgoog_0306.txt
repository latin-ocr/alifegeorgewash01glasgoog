ΤΕΒΤΙΜΟΝΙΔΒΗ·

panson strikes the spectator much aa is, for a personifica·
tion os poetry, a sac-simile os Alexander Pope should be

. set bv the side of the Apollo Bolvidere. Such are my

comparisons between ancient and modern eloquence.
But then Ι am told that we can resort to trqmlations sor
all the spirit of ancient composition. Is all the young
rnen os our country could be taught to read and under-
stand your Life of Washington‚ and then to read a page
ol Livy, Sallust, or Tacitus, and afterward endure a
translation, it would be time to burn up all the classica.
I should be sorry to lose them, and therefore hope your
Liseus Washington may be extensively read.
I am with much respect, sir,
Your obedient servant¹

of Nusltville, Tennessee.

University os Nushville, Dec. ldth, 1⁸³5.

Dran Sru. -I duly receivedyour favour of August
toth, together witha copy of the Life ol Washington‚ by
the late Mr. Glass3 for which, pleaso accept my heany

thanks.

I sully concur in the very savourable opinion of its ex·
traordinary marits expressed by Professor Anthon of
Columbia College. I have, on all suitable occasions,
spoken of the work in such terms as to induce at least
a sew of my acquaintance to purchase it. Our book·
sellers, at my instance, keep a supply on hand. 1 have
recommended it in the newspapers as an excellent text·
book sor the classical school and academy : and l believe
our teachers are about to introduce it accordingly. I
will cheersully do all in my power to extend its circula·
tion in this part of the country.

I here the honour to be, dear sir,
Very respectsully,

Your most obedient servant,

PHILIP LINDSLEY.
